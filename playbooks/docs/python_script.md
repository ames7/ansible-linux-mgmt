# python_script

This playbook takes the output of a custom python script and demonstrates how to use it in subsequent tasks.

## suggested use case

If you have a custom python script that extracts information from any data source (i.e. Excel, web scrape, logs, etc.) and you want to use that as an input to your ansible playbook.

If you are creating a python script from scratch, I **do not recommend** this method and instead point you at the documentation for creating Ansible modules. Modules are typically developed in Python and will simplify the integration of your efforts into automation tasks.

### important notes

The module used to execute a script is called `ansible.builtin.script`. When you call a script from ansible, it generally looks something like this:

```yaml
- name: Run script
  register: r_script_output
  args:
    executable: python3
  ansible.builtin.script: "path/to/your/script.py" # this can also be a variable
```

The return object, registered to `r_script_output` in my example, will have a few keys of interest:
```json
{
    "rc": 0, // the return code
    "stderr": "raw string of anything written to standard error",
    "stdout": "raw string of anything written to standard out",
    "stdout_lines": "standard out lines in the form of an array",
}
```

Given successful execution of your script, you will likely consume either **stdout** or **stdout_lines**. When combining a script with Ansible, I generally like to dump a single object as json in my script and use the **stdout** return key. I prefer this method because you can pipe it to a standard filter plugin and treat it as a structured dictionary from then on. Below is what that looks like on the python side and the ansible side:

```python
# path/to/your/script.py
import json
...
data = {"name": "zach", "company": "Red Hat"}
print(json.dumps(data))
```

Two important steps in the python script worth noting:
1. Use of `print(...)` will register the output in **stdout**. If you are using the python logging library, then you must configure it to pipe to standard out or do some nasty parsing of the **stderr** value in ansible.
1. Use of `json.dumps(...)` will output your python data as a string which will enable the `from_json` filter plugin to work as expected. Without dumping, you will see some red ðŸ™ƒ

```yaml
...

- name: Use filter plugin to transform stdout to structured dictionary
  ansible.builtin.set_fact:
    # from_json is a filter plugin included in ansible
    python_data: "{{ r_script_output.stdout | from_json }}" 

- name: Example using the python data
  ansible.builtin.debug:
    msg: "{{ python_data.name }} works for {{ python_data.company }}"
...
```

I admit this example uses a very simple data structure, but the method will work for any json structure from python -> ansible. That gives you a lot of flexibility to consume output from existing python scripts. If you are looking for a challenge, try rewriting your script to be an Ansible module!
